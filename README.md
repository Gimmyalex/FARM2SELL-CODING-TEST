farmsell-interview - Practical Coding Test Solution

This repository contains the solutions for the practical coding test given for a job application at FarmSell.org. It demonstrates my understanding of web development (using Laravel), mobile application development, SQL queries, and ETL processes (using Apache NiFi).

Project Structure:

Main Components:

Web "Clocking" Application:

This component implements a web-based clocking system using the Laravel framework.

Features include user login/authentication, a dashboard with time/date display, time logging, report viewing, user management (for admins), and logout functionality.

Implemented using Laravel's features like Eloquent ORM, middleware, validation, and blade templating.

Mobile App Development:

The "Practical Assessment Response.pdf" file in the root folder contains answers to the mobile app development questions (pages 10-12) from the test.

It outlines my experience with developing mobile apps, challenges, tools used, preferred frameworks, valuable lessons learned, and testing procedures.

SQL Queries:

The "Practical Assessment Response.pdf" file in the root folder contains the SQL queries written to answer the questions about the "FamilyMembers" and "PreferredMovies" tables (pages 13-14).

Demonstrates understanding of SQL concepts like joins, filtering, and aggregation.


Running the Web Application:

Install Laravel: Follow the installation instructions at https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation to install Laravel.

Database Configuration: Configure the database connection in the .env file with your database credentials.

Database Seeding: Run php artisan db:seed to create the initial admin user in the database.

Start the Server: Run php artisan serve to start the development server.

Access the Application: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to access the application.

Additional Information:

The code in this repository is a simplified implementation and may not include all features or optimizations described in the test document.

The provided code serves as a starting point and can be further extended to incorporate more functionalities and refinements.

The ETL configuration is specifically for Apache NiFi. If you are using a different ETL tool, the configuration and instructions will vary accordingly.

Recommendations:

Implement robust error handling and logging.

Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests.

Implement additional security measures like input validation and sanitization.

Optimize the application for performance and scalability.
